			 The fact that language is dying means that it is my

			 The ubiquity of large print is a large reason for this.
			After all, large print is small potatoes.
			
			 And it is dying, as I see it die, with each book that

			that is written.
			
			 I do not think there is any language left deserving

			 I could pick any kind of letters out of any old book,
