			when i first heard Robert Hass read
			The Modern Prometheus
			 The sound of this machine
			like a siren wailing by itself

			of those who control us
			by making us victims instead
			
			and in our blindness
			we see ourselves as much

			My father pours himself
			 into the cup and spits: I am not thirsty.

			And the zest is gone

			  an old song my mother sang to me when I was thirteen.
			 
			  I couldn't hear it. My mother was short and stocky,
			about five feet tall, rather curvy, than the busty,
			voluptuous songsters.
			 
			 
			  I loved my mother as a sort of saint or goddess, even
			if she was dirty and worn.
			 
			  In junior high, I often lonely-mindedly went to
			hear songs at evenings, alone



			to the dead, the living
			and the unborn, the whole
			mass of them
			lying down
			in the mud
			 in place of the scene
			where the body
			of a woman
			lies, open, flat
			to the cold
			blue earth
			
			No
			blood has flowed
			from this slit
			in the rock
			because of the weaving
			in it
			where the woman
			lies open
			
			to the cold
			blue earth
			
			where the girl

			        you may be right, or you may be wrong. you may be right

			 You're pregnant, you're pregnant, bumping through

			like a bag full of arrows
			Breaking the sound barrier
			As the bricks crisscross in the alley
			I walked on calmly
			then I looked away

			       the voice was rich, flowing, flowing,
			      and such as morn will grow,
			      our love, our love, to end.
			               the song was sweet,
