		Dangerous Noon lyrics
		 The day keeps on coming on like a bribe:
		studying time's handiwork
		by making me wait
		till old enough to catch
		a view of the plain
		long taken from near view
		fish tattered on the lake
		bird artful in leaking words
		words tattooed to the skin
		through repeated expeditions

		asking clouds down here
		 what they are while we stand here
		stretching out their arms
		reaching side into Feng Sh



		 The sky suddenly flows into the corner
		of the room,
		as if there is an interstate
		 or a transcontinental line arteries
		speeding to each other.
		 I am sitting on a sofas in the middle
		of the rug,
		 half-asleep, and the sounds of lavender
		go through the air
		 in my ears, I can almost hear the galloping
		horses
		 as they gallop by, the thud of each stallion
		on the polka-dot.
		 Frost, whispers in my ear, is the color
		of steam.



		     and of these nothing but shadowplay.
		
		     even of myself this verse may foment,
		 my being a cloud enfilraing vapours
		all around me like an action of thanksgiving
		dawn
		
		     from now and then i'll turn the page
		in my face,
		 watching the sky for clouds of me to
		gather.
		
		     never understanding them to be either
		angels or demons,
		 for all their trick of leaving holes
		in cloud, they know the bigger picture
		
		    for them

		The men cheered them

		And the second one

		They didn't listen
