		 I am a true believer in the mysteries
		of memory. Whenever I have doubts about
		a certain theory of time, I am less willing
		to sacrifice the singular for the extended
		duration of time. The problem with
		quantum mechanics, for example, is
		that it seems to violate the conservation
		of value. If time is discrete, then
		increasing the density of the particles
		in a medium increases the energy value
		of the medium, which means that increased
		energy dissipation decreases the
		energy value of the medium. This makes
		it hard for matter to exert conservation
		of value

		 Despite its prevalence and terrors,
		schizophrenia remains one of the least
		understood of the human phenomena.
		The reason for this is that current
		knowledge barely allows us to speculate
		on the mechanisms that underlie human
		mental illness, and little is known
		about these mechanisms. This book
		aims to fill that gap by delving into
		the real-life consequences of understanding
		schizophrenia, both in the social
		and individual sense, as well as the
		social consequences of conceptualizing
		illness. It hopes that this book
