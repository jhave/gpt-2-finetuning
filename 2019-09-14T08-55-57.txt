		 The Sun Remains, and the World
		 On antistrophe, in prose, poetry
		 who is it that turns the soul
		
		from what stirred in thee?
		
		 from what sick thoughts didst thou
		arise
		
		from thy being fostered?
		
		was not this all that felt
		
		in the dark breast?
		
		the grave renders thee,
		
		souls glitter in the grave.
